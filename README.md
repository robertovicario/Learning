## Instructions

Usage:

```sh
bash cmd.sh {setup|notes}
```

### `setup`

If you haven't built the project yet, you can do so by running:

```sh
bash cmd.sh setup
```

### `notes`

The script will automatically generate the `content.pdf` file from the markdown files located in the `docs/md` directory and merge it with your `front.pdf` to create the final `Notes.pdf`:

```sh
bash cmd.sh notes
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Before running this command, ensure to upload your own `front.pdf` into the `dist` directory. You can even let `pandoc` generate a title page for you by updating the `titlepage` field in the `docs/md/__metadata__.yml` file, and removing the `front.pdf` reference from the `cmd.sh` script.
